This is a pairing exercise for prospective front-end developers.

The aim is to create a responsive table similar to the design here: https://app.zeplin.io/project/5c3cda3a252fd04bafbdf3c2/screen/5c3dba5b7324790e48f86570.

The candidate can guide the exercise and do as much as is feasible within the time limit (45mins-1hr).

How to run:

- Create a new branch
- Run `yarn server`
- In a separate process, run `yarn start`
- Go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the basic hello world app
- Work from the `./src` folder in this directory
- At the end of the test, commit candidate's code and push to GitHub
- You can run tests with Jest: `yarn test`

The master branch should be kept clean.
